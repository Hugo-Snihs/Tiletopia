This is the game "Tiletopia". You are presented with a gridmap of tiles, having property of either Empty or Tree. A barbarian also spawns in the beginning of the game, who will spread each day and try to conquer the map. 
Your task is to build houses, churches and roads that connects these to one another. For each connection, you get points and upgrade the houses to Fortress in order to repell the barbarians.
