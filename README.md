This is the game "Tiletopia". You are presented with a gridmap of tiles, having property of either Empty or Tree. A barbarian also spawns in the beginning of the game, who will spread each day and try to conquer the map. 
Your task is to build houses, churches and roads that connects these to one another. For each connection, you get points that will be used to upgrade the houses to Fortress in order to repell the barbarians.

What to write in terminal:

1. git clone https://github.com/Hugo-Snihs/Tiletopia.git
2. npm install -g typescript (For mac: sudo npm install -g typescript)
3. npm install promptSync
4. tsc --strict main.ts; node main.js (Make sure function call to main() at bottom of main.ts is not commented out).

Enjoy!
